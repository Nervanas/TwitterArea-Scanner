I don't want to say it, but to get this to work properly you need to do some  preperations. But - however - since you wouldn't abuse such functions, there shouldn't be a problem with that, right?

1. Get an account at Twitter
2. Verify it by a valid mobile number (not saying that you need to use your own, you only need to access the verification key)
3. Browse to https://apps.twitter.com
4. Click 'Create New App'
5. Fill in the data (you don't need 'Callback URL')
6. Click on the 'Keys and Access Tokens' tab
7. Copy the 'Consumer Key' and 'Consumer Secret'
----- *Attention: Do NOT publish this information, since your account can be taken over with that.. yes it's true.* -----
